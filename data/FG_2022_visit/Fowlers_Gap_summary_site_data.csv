Sheep and kangaroo grazing also occurring. Station destocking sheep. Introduced plant impact is minimal, no introduce plant recorded.

REVISIT: Landform element and pattern is plain on a plain. 1-degree slope to the north east. Surface strew comprised of cobble and pebble size is very common across the site. Geology of surface strew is quartzite, quartz and conglomerate, and soil is cracking clay on the surface.
Minimal or no introduced plant impact. Evidence of kangaroos, goats and sheep, with dung observed on the site, with some species e.g. Tripogonella loliiformis grazed back to butts. Other palatable species such as Astrebla sp. have minimal sign of grazing since the last rain. The research station is currently in the process of destocking. Long unburnt with no evidence of past fire. Nearest infrastructure is the paddock fence line and access track approximately south east 30m from the SE corner.

Complex slope. Plot is quite steep in places. Drainage line that runs to the north west. Top of the site is at the south east and south west. Average 5 degree slope. Flat on southern edge and steeper down into the gullies. Outcrop lithology is mostly banded shale with some quartzite but several sandstone bands also through the site.

Sandstone below the surface. Some cobbles in stream bank and channel, some quartzite and sandstone as in Pit. Modearate impact of introduced plant species- Sisymbrium erysimoides, Leontodon rhagadioloides and Centaurea melitensis low cover.
REVISIT: Flat site. Long unburnt. Site is grazed, cattle scats in the sit but effect is low. Minimal introduced plant species- possible a Brassica species. No surface strew.
